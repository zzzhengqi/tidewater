# Tidewater

A real-time tropical island and ocean for the browser, built with [three.js](https://threejs.org),
WebGPU and TSL (three.js' shader language). Walk the beach, swim the reef, drive the boat, and watch a humpback breach.

**Live demo:** https://zzzhengqi.github.io/tidewater/

## Requirements

- A browser with WebGPU: a recent Chrome, Edge or Safari.
- A capable GPU. It targets 60 fps at 2560×1267 on an Apple M5 Pro, and dynamic resolution scales
  the render down on slower machines.
- The first load compiles several hundred shaders, which can take a minute or more. Later visits are
  faster because the browser caches them.

## Features

**Ocean**
- Four-cascade FFT ocean (Tessendorf spectra) with foam, whitecaps, wind streaks and swell.
- Depth-aware breaking waves with peeling shoulders, whitewater, spray and foam lace.
- A shallow-water simulation for swash running up and down the sand.
- Boat wake and bow spray, and a whale wake.
- Caustics on the seabed and in the water, with light shafts.
- A split underwater/above-water view at the waterline, with water droplets on the lens after surfacing.

**Sky**
- Physically based atmosphere (Hillaire 2020) with a sun, moon and stars.
- Volumetric cumulus and wispy cirrus with cloud shadows on the land.
- Aerial perspective and sea haze.
- God rays, and a lens flare with occlusion.

**World**
- An island with a beach, hills, headlands and rocks.
- A fishing village and a pier.
- A coral reef with fish.
- Palms, broadleaf trees and shrubs with impostors and dithered LOD fades.
- Beach debris.
- Birds, crabs and marine snow.
- A humpback whale with an escort of fish, blows, fluke dives and breaches.

**Lighting and post**
- Cascaded shadows with contact-hardening penumbrae, and screen-space contact shadows.
- Ground bounce light.
- GTAO ambient occlusion.
- Temporal upscaling and sharpening.
- Bloom, auto exposure and motion blur.
- Night lighting from lanterns, windows and the boat, plus a flashlight that also works underwater.

**Audio**
- Positional audio from real CC0 field recordings: surf timed to each breaking wave, wind, birds, the boat
  engine, footsteps by surface, underwater ambience and whale song.

## Controls

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| W A S D | Move |
| Mouse | Look (click to capture the mouse, Esc to release) |
| Shift | Sprint / boat boost |
| Space | Jump / swim up |
| C | Crouch / dive |
| E | Interact, board or leave the boat |
| V | Boat camera (1st / 3rd person) |
| F | Free camera |
| L | Flashlight |
| T | Pause time |
| M | Mute |
| H | Settings panel |
| P | Photo mode |
| F1 or ? | All controls |

The settings panel (H) exposes the sea state, time of day, sun azimuth, clouds, haze, post-processing and
more.

## URL options

Add these to the URL, for example `?fly&noAudio`:

| Option | Effect |
|---|---|
| `fly` | Start in the free camera |
| `noAudio` | Disable sound |
| `noClouds` | Skip the volumetric clouds |
| `noHaze` | Skip the haze and sun shafts |
| `noCaustics` | Skip caustics |
| `noVeg` | Skip vegetation |
| `noSim` | Skip the swash (shallow-water) simulation |

## Running locally

```sh
npm install
npm run dev      # http://127.0.0.1:5188
npm run build    # static build in dist/
```

To inspect the multilingual settings without WebGPU, open `test/i18n.html` directly in a browser.
It is a standalone preview; after changing the UI, regenerate it with `node test/build-i18n-preview.js`.

Every push to `main` deploys to GitHub Pages through `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.
